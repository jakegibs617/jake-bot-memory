  "Why do we jump so quickly from being a member of a group to developing negative reactions to other groups with which we compete? To answer that question, lets think about why people form groups at all. 

  Belonging to a group can offer many benefits. Being in a group gives you people to help you when you need it. And allows you to cooperate with other people on tasks that would be impossible for one person to do alone. Members of a group can pool their resources so that everyone has more available to them than any one person would have by him or herself. And of course groups provide opportunities for social interaction, companionship, support. 
  But joining up with other people is always a bit of a risk. Being in a group is beneficial only if other members of the group cooperate and reciprocate and treat us well. Its very easy to be taken advantage of when other people dont do their share. 

  Because of the risk of being taken advantage of, people dont try to forge new relationships with everybody they meet. You dont go to the mall and just pick people at random to form groups because you dont know if you can trust them. But forming a group allows people to obtain the benefits of many different relationships while minimizing the possible costs, because most groups enforce rules for how the members should treat each other. Thats not to say we dont get taken advantage of by people in our groups. Of course we do. But it happens less within cohesive groups than if we were working in a group of random people who arent members of an identifiable group. 

  By joining groups selectively, people can obtain the advantages of cooperating with other people while minimizing the risks of being taken advantage of. So by defining whos in and whos out of a particular group, group boundaries tell us who is most likely to be cooperative and helpful and trustworthy. All other things being equal, we can usually trust the average member of the groups to which we belong more than we can trust and rely on members of other groups. 

  Of course many of the people who are not members of our group are perfectly nice, trustworthy people. But we dont know which ones. And many people who are not in our groups have no incentive to treat us well. Or if they are members of competing groups, they may be motivated to work against us. So the safest solution is for people to assume that anybody who is not in their group might not be trustworthy. 

  That single somewhat reasonable tactic for protecting ourselves can lead us to view other groups with suspicion and distrust. It might not always be nice, and it can lead to prejudice, conflict and other bad outcomes. But it does make a certain amount of psychological sense. 

  ...

  Its useful to think of this as two distinct biases. A bias to favor ones own group. And a bias to be against another group. These two biases often go together, but not necessarily. I might be bias to see my group in very favorable terms and want good things for my group, but that doesnt necessarily mean that I view your group negatively or want bad things to happen to your group. I might think that your group is just fine, and I wish it all the best, even though I still think that my group is better and Im more invested to be sure that things go well for my group than for yours. 

  Of course, I could hate your group and hope that bad things happen to it. And I might even act in a prejudicial or antisocial way toward people from your group. But the more general pattern is for people to strongly favor their own group but not necessarily wish harm on other groups. In-group favoritism affects our behavior more than outgroup derogation and antagonism.

  To make things worse, research shows that groups of people are less cooperative and more competitive than individuals are. Interindividual-intergroup discontinuity effect

  ...

  Reasonable non prejudicial people who can get along with members of the other group as individuals change somehow when they get into their group. 

  ...

  As individuals, most of us dont like to think of ourselves as unfair or greedy or competitive or prejudice. So we usually try to treat other people with civility and cooperation. Even if we dont like them. But interacting in a group of people encourages a competitive mindset.

  ...

  Prejudice and conflict also intensify when people feel their group is disadvantaged relative to other groups. Doesnt matter much how well a group is doing in an objective sense. When members of a group think that their situation is worse in comparison to other groups, they experience dissatisfaction, and frustration. Theyre more likely to derogate members of other groups. And theyre more likely to behave aggressively. Now, these reactions might be reasonable if the advantaged successful group did something to hold the other group down, but we see this effect even when the more advantaged group isnt in any way responsible for the inequality between the groups. Just feeling less powerful or in a disadvantaged position causes people to show more prejudice. This is why it is so important to minimize political and economic inequalities if we want groups in society to stop fighting with each other. 
   -Professor Mark Leary

  He goes on to explain how even different values can cause prejudicial behavior, including tattoos, sexual orientation, and beliefs to name a few rather than just competitive resources. Humans are the only species that start wars and get into conflicts over ideas and values. He describes that people who feel insecure, judge people more harshly, which may be why low income whites are so prejudicial against minority groups, more so than high income whites. Feeling superior to others can result in people feeling better about themselves. 

  Potential remedies:
   1. Bring the groups together in a space where they have equal status and power 
   a. The situation must require the groups to cooperate towards a common goal
   b. Members of both groups need to become personally acquainted. 
   c. A higher authority needs to help bring these groups together person, laws, social customs, etc.

  2. We can change the way people categorize themselves from Us vs them, to We. Such as if aliens attacked the earth. Then we would all have to work together.",

  "The sad thing about knowledge seeking in any area of life is that we face a split in the road and must make a decision about life. Take the road less traveled, or share experiences with the masses. It so happens that the masses don’t seem to value education in the same degree as the few. Mainly this is what separates them by the default labels. Should you decide to go down the road of greatness or wisdom or any extreme area of interest or passion, you will find it easier to feel lonely. The remedy for this is numbers and social effective connectedness. In the event that you are unable to find like-minded individuals, you must find ways of being more effective with your social time and choices. If you find yourself in the 1% of any category, remember there are 7 Billion people on this planet. This means there are 70 Million people who are also with you in the 1% of any interest in life. That, my friend, is one huge party! To put that number in perspective, if you counted aloud for 89 days without stopping world record then you would only reach 1 Million. Then there is the Dunbar number, which is between 100 and 230. This is the number that states the number of people one knows and keeps social contact with. Lets do the math, 230 / 70 Million gives us 0.000003285 then make it a percent, multiply by 100, which gives us 0.0003285%.  This means, in order to have 230 like minded passionate friends of yours, you need to find a way to contact and engage with 0.0003285 % of 1 % of the population of the world.  Doesnt sound too difficult right? But do we know how to find our like-minded friends? Or do we just live passively and static?",

  "We all share an experience of consciousness which now we have, to a certain degree, taken our understanding and applied theories that, so far, work to set the underlying algorithm for how we experience consciousness. This is huge! 

  Ultimately this opens the door to fully one day be able to have ultimate freedom in who we want to be as individuals apart for the external ingredients and as a species. 

  Our ability to predict an accurate outcome from input is what makes us an intelligent species. Moreover, in our day to day lives, this definition of intelligence remains. 

  For me, my entire life has felt like I could have predicted all outcomes based on looking at the external activities and influences. The hardest question I have, is how one ought to design a way to make a truly free choice. But, of course that may not be possible due to our consciousnesses being predictable. In which case the effort to make a free choice may not ever be of worth. Instead it may be humbling to accept that we are always going to be products of our environments throughout life. But although this may be depressing, it does allow us to choose the life we want to attract, and then plant the seeds to remind us everyday and as often as needed to gravitate towards those outcomes. Hence, that may be it. All life is boiled down to the grain. In other words, life is like a carnival ride, you dont control which carnival came to town, and there are several rides you can choose from. And eventually the carnival will leave and your rides are done.",
  "The old brain is still there. You still have that alligator brain. You do. Its your emotional brain. Its all those gut reactions you have. On top of it, we have this memory system called the neocortex. And the memory system is sitting over the sensory part of the brain. So as the sensory input comes in and feeds from the old brain, it also goes up into the neocortex. And the neocortex is just memorizing. Its sitting there saying, Im going to memorize all the things going on: where Ive been, people Ive seen, things Ive heard, and so on. And in the future, when it sees something similar to that again, in a similar environment, or the exact same environment, itll start playing it back: Oh, Ive been here before, and when you were here before, this happened next. It allows you to predict the future. It literally feeds back the signals into your brain; theyll let you see whats going to happen next, will let you hear the word sentence before I said it.

  "all this time to think is awesome.. ok here is a free-write for who I see myself as, like the about me section. Sorry for the length lol.  
  Im a thinker, an urban philosopher. I love deep conversations about life and big ideas. My goal is to one day be able to live off a garden with residual income to cover all my expenses plus some, and I want to be able to visit a beach in the warm sun during the majority of the year. I care about family being able to use me as they need for support or assistance. My social group is the hustlers, the dreamers, and the givers. I believe that even the most near impossible problems always have hope, and if there is hope then there is a way. If there is a way, it is possible, and if it is possible, I believe that we have the social responsibility to look at the problem objectively and see if we need to make a change in our personal life to impact the greater good.

I believe in becoming fully human, in the sense of understanding how to live like we are meant to and how to make decisions based on our DNA. One reason for that is due to the pure reality of Darwinism, meaning that our DNA is the fragile existence of the universe on a trajectory to become more complex. I believe that we feel fulfilled when we align ourselves with this 13.5 billion-year-old trajectory. I am someone who always tries to imagine other perspectives for how to see any reality or truth. I’ve trained a martial art called Capoeira Angola in a group since I was 15, and this group is beyond special to me. The core philosophy of how that group operates is a significant part of who I am today. Professionally I have experience being an artist, a teacher, and a project manager for tech. My current growth area in my life is looking for a way to properly balance my hunger for knowledge and growth with making enough social connections with others. That being said, I also believe that we become like the five people we spend the most time with, and so who I spend my time with is important to me. My 2-year goal is to be making residual income from a property. This means I will likely need a new 9-5 job, and maybe live in Providence but work in Boston, but nothing is set in stone yet. I am a planner, a systems person. I believe in practicing good listening, and being impeccable with my word. I try to live in the present by making a system around me not having to spend the majority of the day trying to cram-think for the future. I don’t like procrastinating, if the time is right to get something done, then action must take place. The complexity of that action, however, is meant for the left side of the brain to figure out in the moment. I am an oil painter, and I must always have access to a studio to paint. This is non-negotiable for me. Lastly, people say I am pretty corny, I agree, and I like the idea of one day being an awesome grandparent 😃.",

  "Fiji for me

  You are a wanderer in life, who wonders why work is so important, and would much rather be relaxing on the sand. You are adventurous and love to be outdoors, whether its on land or in the water. You thrive in smaller towns with a strong sense of community and spirituality. Your spirituality is not fed by traditional religion, however... you are much more intrigued by the idea of many Gods and find solace around lush tropical flowers and wildlife. You are not lazy, per se, but are rejuvenated by a day of quiet meandering and can easily read a book on the beach all day. When you want to have fun, you are game for that too. You gather with some close friends and enjoy cocktails on a lanai or near the water. The water is your source of soul nourishment, and you also enjoy a diet of fresh produce and sea life.",

My grandmother Nana died when I was in high school, and the memories I have of spending time with her are some of my all-time favorite memories in my life. Every time she spoke, there was a plethora of information to learn, and the way she spoke was captivating and intense. She was an incredible human being to say the least, and she sent me to learn this martial art. So, this martial art has acted as all I have to fully learn every lesson she wanted to pass down to me. I have trained this art for 10 years at this point and I am so grateful for this to be in my life and it has had a serious influence on who I am today. The lessons of facing danger with tranquility and joy and making art and beauty out of the situation are what I live for. At this point, I think it is one of my top skills as a human being, and it is incredibly fun at the same time.",

The oldest written stories of humankind have set in stone many great examples for us men to follow. From Gilgamesh to Odysseus to Moses, tales have paved the way for us to imagine our futures, they have planted the necessary seeds in our minds to help us sow our own destinies and repel the notion of fate, these heroic novels have offered a role for us as boys to grow into. This is a perspective to bring out the kings and the sages in our young boys so that we can never give up in the face of adversity. For life is a perilous plight of which predicting a future can be both rewarding as well as tragic, the greatest gift God has for us all is the surprise of tomorrow. For tomorrow holds the wild card, a card that may range in completeness to utter destruction. Must we never forget our stories across all sub-cultures. May we see past our differences and know when to relinquish our needs to be alphas. May we learn patience and respect for others through our internal dignity and vision. May we build the strength to walk that valley of death and fear no evil. And may we embrace humility knowing that our brothers are on the same path in greater numbers than are humanly imaginable. 

  Of course anything may be abused or pushed to the extremes to a degree of toxicity. This is just a sliver in what men carry on our shoulders. This is not at all a comparison to women. This is simply a celebration of life and the courage to endure and push forward.",

You can babysit little children without anyone raising an eye. You can have meetings with white women and no one will point fingers. You are an ideal citizen. You do not have to try if you don’t want to. When you wear Afrocentric apparel you are seen as intelligent or cultural. You are not black. No matter how many black friends you may have, it doesn’t change how police will see you. Your knowledge of racism comes 2nd hand. You can read about it or hear stories and other accounts of it, but it does not happen to you. Sometimes it may feel like regardless of every attempt you make, you are under attack by black folk for your use of language and “slip ups with racist moments. You may fall in the boat of, clearly everything in ‘white’ life already is better than ‘black’ life, so you have the moral obligation to be a nice ‘white’ person. Stop yourself for a moment. Think about this assumption for a moment. What is making you think that is justified or true? Because you learned it in your ‘white’ home growing up? Because you learned it in your ‘white’ school system? Because you watch ‘white’ media share their perspective reaffirming this prejudice? If you as a ‘white’ member in this society truly want to balance the scale for your conscience, think about this. There were Great kingdoms in Africa before the Romans and Greeks. Modern civilization would not be able to exist without the successes and riches from the African Continent. Cleopatra was African, the concept of a beat and rhythm in your favorite songs is African, the whole concept of vaccines originated from Africans. Your need for yoga and infusing more spiritual, mental and physical balance in your life exists in every tribal culture in the African Continent. The question is, honestly to yourself, do you think or believe that the ‘black’ race knew anything of value before white people came? Before the missionaries, before the kidnapping, before the false promises, before the crack of the whip, before the redefinition of slavery, before the greed, before the false emancipation, before the false separate but equal, before the stocking of the prisons, before the white guilt, before President Obama?
   Question is, can you list on your fingers 5 or 10 African contributions to society? Then ask yourself whose responsibility is it, to educate in a fair balanced way. Are you still the ‘white’ savior swooping in to be nice and embodying morality to help the world? Or have you become the idiot who must not have parked their car here. Dude. 
   Educate yourself. 
   If you want to balance yourself. 
   Educate yourself.

  "The United States criminal justice system is the largest in the world. At yearend 2011, approximately 7 million individuals were under some form of correctional control in the United States, including 2.2 million incarcerated in
  federal, state, or local prisons and jails.1 The U.S. has the highest incarceration rate in the world, dwarfing the rate of nearly every other nation.2

  Such broad statistics mask the racial disparity that pervades the U.S. criminal justice system. Racial minorities are more likely than white Americans to be arrested; once arrested, they are more likely to be convicted; and once convicted, they are more likely to face stiff sentences. African-American males are six times more likely to be incarcerated than white males and 2.5 times more likely than Hispanic males.3 If current trends continue, one of every three black American males born today can expect to go to prison in his lifetime, as can one of every six Latino males—compared to one of every seventeen white males.4 Racial and ethnic disparities among women are less substantial than among men but remain prevalent.5",
  "THE greatest problem is not with flat-out white racists, but rather with the far larger number of Americans who believe intellectually in racial equality but are quietly oblivious to injustice around them. Too many whites unquestioningly accept a system that disproportionately punishes blacks and that gives public schools serving disadvantaged children many fewer resources than those serving affluent children. We are not racists, but we accept a system that acts in racist ways.

  Some whites think that the fundamental problem is young black men who show no personal responsibility, screw up and then look for others to blame. Yes, that happens. But I also see a white-dominated society that shows no sense of responsibility for disadvantaged children born on a path that often propels them toward drugs, crime and joblessness; we fail those kids before they fail us, and then we, too, look for others to blame.",

  "A normal black child having grown up with a normal family, will become abnormal at the slightest contact with the white world. This argument may not be immediately understandable. Let us proceed therefore by going backward. In recognition of Dr. Breuer, Freud writes: in almost every case, we could see that the symptoms were so to speak, like residues of emotional experiences, to which for this reason we gave the name of psychic traumas. Their individual characters were linked to the dramatic scenes that had provoked them. According to the classic terminology, the symptoms were determined by scenes of which they were mnemonic residues, and it was no longer necessary to regard them as arbitrary and enigmatic effects of the neurosis. In contrast, however, to what was expected, it was not always a single event that was the cause of the symptom; most often, on the contrary, it arose out of multiple traumas, frequently analogous and repeated. As a result, it became necessary to reproduce chronologically this whole series of pathogenic memories, but in reverse order: the latest at the beginning and the earliest at the end; it was impossible to make ones way back to the first trauma, which is often the most forceful, if one skipped any of its successors. 
  ...
  Freud adds
  This trauma, it is true, has been quite expelled from the consciousness and the memory of the patient and as a result he has apparently been saved from a great mass of suffering, but the repressed desire continues to exist in the unconscious; it is on watch constantly for an opportunity to make itself known and it soon comes back into consciousness, but in a disguise that makes it impossible to recognize; in other words, the repressed thought is replaced in consciousness by another that at as its surrogate, its Ersatz, and that soon surrounds itself with all those feelings of morbidity that had been supposedly averted by the refreshing.",

To be surprised by the flooding of our prisons by a select group of people is insulting. We must support our youth and fight inequity and ignorance in order to heal our corrupt and toxic system.",

  "Greetings my Relatives, Friends and Supporters

  As I have said so many times in the past I am deeply and truly honored that you remember me on this day and I am honored to have my words read to you today.  I think this commemoration day should be about the lives of all our people who in some way lived and died for us.

  By the time of the Oglala shoot-out there had already been some 60 something of our Native people killed.  These people are the ones we are commemorating here today.  I always especially remember Joe Stunz,  who was a mentor to some of the younger boys in the community.

  Of all the things I want us to remember today and everyday, I want us to remember who WE are, I want us to remember where WE came from, I want us to remember our ancestors that we are so proud of , and I want us to live in such a way that our children and our children’s-children will look back at us and be proud of who they are because of what we were.

  I want to see a day where our people do not have to depend on any other source than ourselves.

  I want to see a day where our people aren’t suffering from the bitter cold in the winter months.

  A day where our people are not suffering from mal-nutrition  and improper medical care.

  I want to see fires burning inside well built homes that are not unstable and falling apart.

  I want to see a day where alcoholism and drug abuse is not rampant throughout indian country.

  There are so many other things I could mention that need to change, and I will tell you for a fact they won’t start changing until WE change them.

  We must look back to our traditions. We must look back to our own cultures and the teachings of our elders who taught us that the greatest gift the creator gave us was our bodies in good health and the Earth around us.  We must remember from our traditions, that it is our responsibility to take care of our bodies and health and the bodies and health of our children,

  Our traditions also taught us to be the caretakers of all the nature around us.

  There is an old saying back when the Buffalo were almost totally done away with, I think there were only about 25 or so left, in the U.S., the saying was that when the Buffalo come back, the American Indian would also come back.  Well, the Buffalo are back, they are not what they were, but they are thriving.  WE are also coming back, and we are not what we were yet, but we will be.

  I know things have changed, as they always do and we must rise to meet those challenges. Everything in life is based on some challenge and we have faced challenge after challenge and we are still here.  I want to encourage all of you from the depths of my soul and with my deepest prayers;  to set up programs for our children that would teach them the survival skills that it will take to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.  To find ways to protect and restore our Earth.

  As a man I encourage you men out there to step up stronger than you have been, more determined than you have been, more consistent and persevering than you have been,and do all you can to make this a better place for all people.

  Our enemies are many, but most of it has to do with money.  People, at times, love money more than the Creator, or the gifts the creator gave us.   Our people will be approached even more in the coming future to sell off our lands and our resources and we must do what we can to protect them for our children and the coming generations.

  We must also at every opportunity remind the Gov’t of the agreements and treaties they have made with our people.   We should also remind them at every opportunity that the Black Hills are still ours, and the lease is up. We should also remind them, at every opportunity that we are part of the treaty they call the constitution and that we should be respected and given every equal right under that agreement.   One thing in particular that the constitution says,  is that you will receive a trial with a jury of your peers and yet every indian that is arrested and tried in federal court is triedoff the reservation, there is no jury of our peers.

  That is just one point, there are many.

  I know for a fact that our people have it within their blood, history and understandings, to win out over this time of trial that our people have been going through for a couple hundred years now.

  If we want things to be different we are going to have to DO them different.

  When I think about our young people and elders who commit suicide I am full of sorrow. When I hear about what is happening to Mother Earth, I weep with anguish.

  These things won’t change until we take responsibility for making that change ourselves.   These corporations are not embarrassed at all by hurting us.  They always find some legal, moral or religious reason to justify stealing from us.  We as a people must take responsibility, rise to the challenge and teach our children to be able to face that challenge.  We need to get back to eating the foods that our bodies are designed for, the ceremonies that our hearts and spirits are designed for, and the love and caring for one another that we are ALL designed for.

  A wise elder once said you cannot live with one foot in a White mans canoe and one in an Indians canoe, you have to choose one or the other.  He said that in relation to perhaps culture, but when we look at the destruction of the air and the water and the soil and the dangerous possibilities that face all mankind that are taking place right now, we are all in the same boat.

  I always remember Floyd Red Crow Westerman once said, that the flowers are not all the same color… the birds don’t all sing the same song but together, they make a beautiful forest. I know for a fact there are people of other races and other colors that feel the same way we do,  and when we meet them, we need to join together to stop this common destruction that faces all mankind.   There can be no diversity of life on an Earth that cannot sustain life.

  I was and am a common man just like you, but in all of this, I came to realize that each of us carries within him the spirit of our people and wherever we go,  whether we like it or not, we represent our people.  Since I was hauled off to boarding school it has been the same fight,  If I would just admit that this Government is always right and never wrong, and if our people would back off from the position of remaining who we are and stop clinging to our cultures, to assimilate, etc, etc…. but in my heart of hearts and in the core of my being I have always remembered what so many of our people have lived and died for,  I have remembered that they died for the right to remain on their own land where the creator put us. They lived and died for the right to practice our religion that was given to us.  They lived and died to be able to keep their children among them and not be taken off to some boarding school.  They lived and died for the right to be Indian, by OUR standards not theirs. I have done my best to live up to that all my days

  I am tired, and at kind of at a loss for words now, and I am sure you are all sitting in the hot sun about ready for some cool water and a breeze, but in closing I want to say that

  I miss you. 

  I long to be with you.

  I long to have the sun shining on me without the shadow of bars or chain link fencing in the way. 

  I long to see an eagle circling the Sundance grounds.

  I long for the touch and hugs of close friends and loved ones.

  I long for life as a free man.

  I will never give up, on who we are.  I encourage you to stay strong and be a good representative of our people wherever you go.  Be an encouragement and a source of strength for those in need.

  Wherever they put me, or keep me, or lock me away,- rest assured that my heart and prayers are always with you

  "definitely funny, but also important to watch. It breaks down the monetary system in a easy to understand way for people who have no perception of the danger of the monetary system we accept by doing nothing. My only criticism is the story ends without any real action, this is a reoccurring issue I have with many of these videos. It is easy to point out problems, but much harder to pose solutions. However we must start with recognizing the problems we face in order to fully be able to start to fix things. ",
